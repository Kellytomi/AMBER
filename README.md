## Welcome to Amber!

**Be Your Brother's Keeper** - Amber is a revolutionary mobile app that transforms everyday users into a network of community first-aiders. Originally conceptualized in 2022 as a UI/UX case study by Elvis Obi and collaborators including Josh Ayokhai, we're now bringing this vision to life. Amber acts as a pseudo-life insurance platform, empowering people to report live incidents or emergencies in real-time, fostering a crowdsourced alert system that connects communities for faster responses to accidents, health crises, and more.

By participating, users not only help others but also unlock insurance perks and rewards, creating a symbiotic ecosystem where safety and support go hand-in-hand. Whether you're a developer, designer, first-aid enthusiast, or just passionate about community-driven tech, join us in building a safer world!

## The Problem We're Solving

In today's fast-paced world, emergencies can happen anywhere, but response times often lag due to centralized systems. Amber addresses this by decentralizing aid through user-generated reports, turning smartphones into lifesaving tools. It targets urban dwellers, commuters, and communities in areas with limited emergency services, promoting proactive safety and mutual support.

## Key Features (Planned and In Development)

- **Incident Reporting**: Quickly log emergencies with location, photos, and details to alert nearby users.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Receive notifications about incidents in your vicinity and respond as a first-aider.
- **Community Rewards**: Earn points or insurance discounts for verified contributions and responses.
- **User Profiles**: Track your first-aid certifications, response history, and community impact.
- **Integrated Mapping**: Seamless GPS integration for accurate location-based alerts.
- **Insurance Integration**: Tie into partner programs for pseudo-life coverage based on participation.
- **Intuitive UI**: Clean, purple-themed design focused on ease-of-use during high-stress situations.

We're starting with core MVP features and expanding based on community feedback.

## Development Approach: Vibe Coding

This project is being entirely vibe-coded, meaning we're leveraging AI-assisted development where code is generated through prompts and iterative vibes rather than traditional line-by-line coding. This approach allows for rapid prototyping, creative experimentation, and community involvement in shaping the app. It's perfect for a project like Amber, emphasizing intuition, collaboration, and quick iterations. While Elvis will handle some vibe coding alongside design and community management, the overall process invites contributors to join in this fun, AI-powered workflow.

Note: Vibe-coded projects are great for ideation but will be refined by developers for production readiness. We're mostly open to contributions, but some technical skills are required even for non-dev tasks to ensure smooth integration.

## Team

- **Elvis Obi**: Managing design, community, and some vibe coding.
- **Josh Ayokhai**: Managing development and vibe coding.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- Yarn or npm
- Expo CLI (for React Native development)

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/amber-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd amber-app
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   yarn install
   ```
4. Set up environment variables (copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in API keys).

### Running Locally
- For development: `yarn start`
- Build for iOS/Android: Follow Expo docs for deployment.

## Tech Stack

While the original concept was a design prototype, we're building the app using:
- Frontend: React Native for cross-platform mobile development.
- Backend: Node.js with Express, or Firebase for real-time features.
- Database: MongoDB or Firestore for user data and incidents.
- Mapping: Google Maps API or Mapbox.
- Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging.

Contributions to refine or expand this stack are welcome, especially through vibe coding experiments!

## Contributing

We're thrilled you're interested in joining our community! This project is open to all levels of participation—we encourage everyone to get involved, whether through vibe coding, design, feedback, documentation, or non-technical roles. No prior experience is required for many contributions; we value diverse perspectives to make Amber truly community-driven.

### Ways to Contribute
- **Technical Roles**: Vibe coding, frontend/backend development, bug fixes, feature implementation.
- **Design & UX**: UI refinements, wireframing, user testing.
- **Community & Outreach**: Moderating discussions, organizing events, content creation, user engagement.
- **Safety & Security Focused**: Developing guidelines for incident verification, privacy policies, moderation tools, ethical AI usage, or advising on secure data handling—even if not tech-related at all.
- **Other Non-Technical Roles**: Research on emergency response best practices, partnership outreach, translation for global accessibility, or simply sharing ideas and feedback.
